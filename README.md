# Background
  The human brain is very powerful. More powerful than the pathetic physical capabilities of a mere eye muscle. Believe it or not, your brain can read faster than your eyes can move. So why can reading be so slow sometimes? As a student, I'd like to imagine I'm on 100% battery every time I sit down to read my textbooks but the fact is: I'm not. A full time workload can be exhausting - and keeping up with assigned reading is physically demanding. So what if I didn't even have to move my eyes to read? What if I could just stream words directly into my mind palace? It would technically be less ACP wasted by my body if I didn't have to move my eyes at all. What if reading actually became restful and cathardic? 
  I find I'm not the only one of my peers looking for shortcuts to learning. Students always turn to resources like Chegg or StackOverflow when they need a condensed form of information about the text they probably should have read. If reading and understanding a textbook was just as easy as googleing, there wouldn't be a need for Quizlet. With the goal of improving the condition of studying from a book in mind, we created Reading Rotator.
